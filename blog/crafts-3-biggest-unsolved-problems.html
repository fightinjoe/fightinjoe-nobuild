      Craft's 3 Biggest Unsolved Problems

        <p>Craft was once commonplace; now it&apos;s niche. Not too long ago, it was normal to know your local potter, weaver, and jeweler by name. Now you&apos;re lucky to live in a town that supports a tailor. So where do you go to find luthiers, cobblers, and broomsquires? The <a href="https://smithsoniancraftshow.org/" target="_blank">Smithsonian Craft Show</a>! As a hobbyist maker, the chance to meet the foremost US master craftspeople and see their beautiful creations is super inspiring. And as a cofounder of LocalBy, learning about the unsolved problems makers face is essential to our mission of helping makers thrive.</p>

        <small>The 120 craft booths in the National Building Museum</small>
      </div>
      <p>Imagine walking into a museum and seeing exhibits that are staffed by the artists, with pieces on display that you can own - this is what it&apos;s like to attend the Smithsonian Craft Show. The annual 5 day event contains a juried selection of 120 artists and their beautiful handmade objects. Designed for everything from display to decoration to daily use, these modern heirlooms are incredibly diverse both in technique and topic. The items were familiar as tufted rugs, delicate as hammered baby spoons, and exotic as medieval inspired carved leather. When the May dates were announced, I bought a multi-day pass and train ticket to DC without a second thought.</p>
      <p>The opening night preview was buzzing. Kicked off by a marching band, the evening&apos;s focus was awards and recognitions, followed by cocktails and hors d'oeuvres. Artists were either making final booth preparations or catching their breath, enjoying the calm before the storm. Everyone I spoke with was honored to be chosen as an exhibitor, acutely aware of the time investment: 5 full days on their feet in full sales mode + 2 days for setup / teardown / transit = at least a week away from their studio and their craft. For many this was the first of several fairs they&apos;d travel 100s (if not 1000s) of miles to visit this season.</p>
      <p><em>This highlights the first unsolved problem: <strong>management</strong>.</em> Making it as a craftsperson increasingly requires more and more time spent managing, to the detriment of time spent making. To succeed, you must manage social media content, manage inventory and logistics, manage customers and fulfillment, and often manage a household. These management jobs are never finished. What solutions exist are poorly integrated, have a high learning curve, and require a lot of time. Once a piece is finished, most makers must take photos, make a video, upload a story to Instagram and Pinterest, and update inventory on Shopify and Etsy. Simplifying just one portion of this would be a big benefit to makers.</p>
      <p>I left when the doors closed the first night, still hungry for more. It was energizing and exciting to be part of such a unique event, even if it was just as a visitor. The role, skill, and value of craft were all on full display, where they&apos;re typically hidden by the comfort of sofa shopping and 2 day shipping. I couldn&apos;t help but wonder what local fairs, markets, bazaars, art walks, and studio crawls I had been missing out on.</p>
      <p><em>This highlights the second unsolved problem: <strong>discovery</strong>.</em> Google, Amazon, and Etsy searches for handmade goods often returns “craft-washed” (artisanal but mass-manufactured) goods promoted to the top as ad placements. This makes it hard for small scale makers to break through the ecommerce noise and find their audience. It&apos;s even harder locally, especially without a storefront, which is unfortunate since both makers and buyers prefer local sales. LocalBy is working to solve the local discovery problem, so this is an issue near and dear to us.</p>
      <p>I returned the moment the doors opened the second day, looking to gather and bring home as much inspiration from the makers as I could. I met:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><a href="https://www.hannahbeatricequinn.com" target="_blank">Hanna</a> who deliberately prices her brooms to be used</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.saboteuse.com/" target="_blank">Sarah</a> who is rejuvenating the Boston&apos;s lost art of bootmaking</li>
        <li><a href="http://amberpoitier.com/" target="_blank">Alicia</a> who is equally inspired by New York architecture and Jamaican oceans</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.jonasblade.com" target="_blank">Zachary</a> who got connected to a knife making community through the steel baron of New Jersey</li>
        <li><a href="http://prideandarchivejewelry.com/" target="_blank">Summer</a> who repurpose exotic wood scraps and <a href="http://treyjonesstudio.com/" target="_blank">Trey</a> who repurposes plywood offcuts (both to spectacular effect)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.cambiumlostarts.com" target="_blank">Amy</a> who is bringing Appalachian basket weaving to the Catskills mountains,</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and countless others. Nothing beats meeting makers and seeing their art in person, but oddly, no digital experience even comes close.</p>
      <p><em>This highlights the third unsolved problem: <strong>collaboration</strong>.</em> Buying a hand-blown decanter to commemorate an anniversary is not like buying a pair of Nike Air Jordans. Shopping for handmade goods is often an involved, complex, and collaborative process, and the internet does a poor job of facilitating this. Handmade items carry meaning: how they were made, what inspired them, how they feel, and if they are customized. A decision to puchase is also a decision to invest in the maker. Instagram, Kickstarter, and Patreon all hold pieces of the puzzle, but all work independently and homogenize the maker-shopper relationship.</p>
      <p>I left the show with not only heaps of insight (and several new heirlooms) but also an optimism about the future. All of the crafts and skills on display have survived 100s of years, with some even being rediscovered and resurrected. In this historical context, the unsolved problems of management, discovery, and collaboration are really <em>opportunities to create modern tools and experiences</em> supporting the vibrant craft community. </p>
